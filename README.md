# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Prediction
This project demonstrates a simple machine learning approach to predict factors that influence student grades using a dataset stored in a CSV file.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The dataset contains information about students from different nationalities and grade levels, along with key determining factors such as:

- Number of hands raised
- Number of attendances
- Hours studied
- And more

The goal of this project is to analyze these factors and predict their impact on student performance.

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models

Several classifiers and machine learning models have been implemented and compared to achieve the most accurate predictions of the factors affecting student marks.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

To better understand the results, visual aids have been generated, including:

- Graphs for data insights
- Confusion matrices for model evaluation

This project provides a hands-on demonstration of applying machine learning techniques to an educational dataset, highlighting the relationship between study habits, engagement, and student success.
